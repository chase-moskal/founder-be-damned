# FOUNDER BE DAMNED
&nbsp; &nbsp; — *by Chase Moskal*

<br/>

## Fuck you

Deciding to become a tech founder was an overconfident, grandiose, and arrogant thing for you to do. And you deserve to be punished. And you will be.

You think you can build your own app, and make money? A new technology, and change the industry? Something beautiful, and people appreciate it? What the fuck is wrong with you, and why do you think you could be a *somebody?*

Imagine trying to become a StarCraft grandmaster. How many games would you lose? Stomped. Humiliated. Stupid mistakes. Revealed to be inadequate. But, how could it be otherwise? The path for the technical founder, the true builder, is no different. Well, except that StarCraft is supposed to be fun, isn't it?

The truth is, you are *inadequate*. You will fail. You'll disappoint yourself. You'll let everybody down. You'll become a drain. Loved ones will lose faith in you. Friends will argue against you. They'll *hope* for you to fail. *See? I told you...* But don't you deserve it? After all, you're being *cosmically* arrogant.

But, maybe you won't fail? Maybe you could get lucky on your first swing. But then... what about the second? Or, maybe you're already adequate for the task. You won't have any catastrophes! You're just as great as your parents, teachers, and bosses have told you. Yeah OK bud... maybe you should get into StarCraft? I think Serral's online today...

But here's the thing: people *do* become grandmasters, don't they? If you're at least a midwit, and you made it your life goal, do you think you could become a grandmaster too? Watch their twitch streams. Do you think these guys are god-gifted wizards, or have they played tens of thousands of games while losing about half as many?

Can you become a grandmaster at building cool shit that people love?

### Eating broken glass, staring into the abyss

*Victory or death!* Feels good to say, doesn't it?

Feels different when you're losing balance standing at the chasm's edge. This won't make you happy. It's not fun. If you're pessimistic, a ruminator, if you get sad sometimes, if people depend on you — *get the hell out.* Close this now. Go live a normal happy life. Go home to your girlfriend, watch netflix, and get ready for work tomorrow.

Still here? You can't be deterred? You really are an arrogant fucker. Have you at least been doing your homework? Doesn't it seem like all these damn startup books are written by "people-people"? Impress an angel investor. Hiring is about building your *culture.* The *bay area!* But, they seem to be glossing over something... hey wait — didn't somebody have to actually *build* this shit? Fine, you can keep "Zero to One", the old YC Stanford vids, and your PG essays.

This "book" or whatever, is not written in retrospect. It's about the strategy and tactics of building. It's about the builder's mind. It's about you, your keyboard, and your demons.

This is about what you must become.

### It's your fault

If you really want to be extraordinary, then you don't get to have ordinary life. That was a privilege, and you traded it in. Work-life balance? Are you kidding me? Carmack and Blow would like a word with you.

Every time you fail, you'll have nobody to blame but yourself. And nobody will feel sorry for you. And they shouldn't. After all — *you* fucked up — if you had built it fast enough, and it worked enough, and people used it enough, then it wouldn't have failed.

You've done this to yourself.

### What's it all for?

Simple: *Boats 'n Hoes.*

No, seriously, you actually can't be *entirely* driven by a lust for money, luxury, and free time. Maybe if you hit it big, you might have those things when you retire... but if that's what really motivates you *now?* Then you won't make it. In fact, the path involves the exact opposite. May I interest you instead, with decades of uncertainty, stress, and workaholism?

You'd better be driven by an unquenchable inner flame that you don't understand. To live fully, do you need something worth dying for? That's hard to come by in the modern world. What do you seek? Something personal like greatness, legacy, respect, or command? Are you trying to prove something about yourself? Or maybe it's something impersonal and altruistic like creating art that is beautiful, or providing tools that are useful? Whatever dude, it better be some deep-rooted psychological shit like that.

A cheap laptop is the only equipment required to unlock an unbounded ability to build incredible things that touch the lives of millions. If only you knew how to type the right keystrokes to pull it off.
