# FOUNDER BE DAMNED
&nbsp; &nbsp; — *by Chase Moskal*

<br/>

## Chapter 1: *Fuck you*

### Delusions of grandeur

Deciding to become a tech founder was an overconfident, grandiose, and arrogant thing for you to do. And you deserve to be punished. And you will be...

A cheap laptop is all you need to touch the lives of millions. Wielding the device properly, you could alchemically conjure vast sums of money into your bank account (among other neat spells). If only you knew how to type the right sequence of keystrokes. Too bad software is the hardest thing in the world.

The right kind of tech founder — *the true builder* — is a wizard with such skills.

But... *you?*

You are inadequate. And you will fail. You'll let everybody down, and your friends and family will lose faith in you. Most will argue against you, hoping for you to fail. You'll even disappoint yourself.

But don't you deserve it, really? After all, you've been cosmically arrogant.

### Encounters with the unforgiving

Imagine trying to become a starcraft grandmaster. How many games should you expect to lose? Stomped. Humiliated. Stupid mistakes! The true builder's path is no different. Except that starcraft is supposed to be fun, isn't it?

But wait, maybe you won't fail building your first tech thing? You could get lucky on your first swing. But then what about the second? Is relying on luck a good strategy? Or, maybe you're already perfectly adequate for the task, just as great as your parents, teachers, and bosses have told you all your life. You won't have any catastrophes! Yeah, you really should get into starcraft — you'll be a *natural.*

Here's the thing though: people *do* attain grandmaster rank, don't they? Watch their twitch streams: are these guys all god-gifted ubermensch gigachads? Or have they just played tens of thousands of games, while losing about half as many? If you're at least a midwit, and you made it your life goal, could you too become a grandmaster one day?

Could you become a grandmaster at building cool tech shit that people love?

### Eating broken glass and staring into the abyss

*Victory or death!* Feels good to say, doesn't it?

Hits different when you're losing balance at the chasm's edge. This won't make you happy. It's not fun. If you have neurotic tendencies, or you're a ruminator, if you get sad sometimes, or somebody depends on you — *then get the hell out!* Go home to your girlfriend, live a normal happy life, watch netflix. Close this now, just remember to set an alarm for work tomorrow.

Still here? You can't be deterred? You really are an arrogant fucker.

You want to do something extraordinary? Well, you don't get to have an ordinary life anymore. That was a privilege, and you just sold it. *Work-life balance,* are you kidding me? Carmack and Blow would like a word with you. And don't forget: every time you fail, you'll have nobody to blame but yourself, and nobody should feel sorry for you. You chose this.

A lust for fat stacks of cash? *Boats 'n hoes?* Forget it! Maybe you'll get that in the end, but in the meantime, may I interest you instead with decades of uncertainty, stress, and workaholism?

Do you have an inexhaustible inner flame? Do you crave power, or recognition? Are you doing God's work? Whatever dude, it better be some deep psychological shit for you to work out with your therapist. Actually, don't — it works better this way.

### Have you at least been doing your homework?

Doesn't it seem like all these startup books are written by "people-people"? Impress an angel investor. Hiring is about *culture.* Networking in the *bay area!* But hold on — didn't somebody have to actually *build* this shit? Fine, you can keep your pg essays.

This book is not written in retrospect. It's about building. It's about the builder's mind. It's about you, your keyboard, and your demons.

This is about what you must become.
