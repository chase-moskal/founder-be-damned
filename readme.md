# FOUNDER BE DAMNED
&nbsp; &nbsp; â€” *by Chase Moskal*

## Chapter 1: ***Fuck you***

Deciding to become a founder was a confident, grandiose, and arrogant thing for you to do. And you deserve to be punished. And you certainly will be.

The path to becoming a StarCraft grandmaster, involves losing *so many* StarCraft games. Dominated and humiliated. Revealed to be unworthy. Inadequate. How could it be otherwise? The path for the technical founder, the true builder, is no different. Well, except that StarCraft is *usually* fun.

You are *inadequate*. You will fail. You will disappoint yourself. You will let everybody down. You'll become a drain. Loved ones will lose faith in you. Friends will argue against you. They'll become defensive. They'll come to *hope* you'll fail. *See? I told you...* But don't you deserve it? After all, you're being *cosmically* arrogant.

But, maybe you won't fail? Maybe you could get lucky on your first swing? But... what about the second? Or, maybe you're already adequate for the task. You won't have any catastrophes! You're just as great as your parents, teachers, and bosses have told you. Yeah, okay... maybe you should get into StarCraft? I think Serral's online today...

Doesn't it seem like all these damn startup books are written by "people-people"? Impress an angel investor! Hiring is about building your "culture". The *bay area!* But didn't somebody have to *actually* build this shit?

This "book" or whatever, is not written in retrospect. It's about mental models for becoming a less inadequate builder. It's about the real construction process. It's about you, your keyboard, and your demons.
