# FOUNDER BE DAMNED
&nbsp; &nbsp; — *by Chase Moskal*

<br/>

## Chapter 1: *Fuck you*

Deciding to become a tech founder was an overconfident, grandiose, and arrogant thing for you to do. And you deserve to be punished. And you will be.

You are *inadequate.* You will fail. Friends and family will lose faith in you. You'll let everybody down. Everybody will argue against you. They'll even *hope* for you to fail. You'll even disappoint yourself. *See? I told you.*

But don't you deserve it, really? After all, you're being *cosmically* arrogant.

### Delusions of grandeur

A cheap laptop is all you need to touch the lives of millions. If only you could type the right sequence of keystrokes. Too bad software is the hardest thing in the world.

Imagine trying to become a starcraft grandmaster. How many games would you lose? Stomped. Humiliated. Stupid mistakes! The builder's path is no different. Except that starcraft is supposed to be fun, isn't it?

But, maybe you won't fail building your first product? You could get lucky on your first swing. But then what about the second? Or maybe you're already adequate for the task, just as great as your parents, teachers, and bosses have told you all your life. You won't have any catastrophes! Yeah, you really should get into starcraft — you'll be a *natural.*

Here's the thing though: people *do* attain grandmaster. Watch their twitch streams: are these guys god-gifted ubermensch wizards, or have they played tens of thousands of games and lost about half as many? If you're at least a midwit, and you made it your life goal, do you think you could become a grandmaster one day?

Could you become a grandmaster at making cool shit that people love?

### Eating broken glass and staring into the abyss

*Victory or death!* Feels good to say, doesn't it?

Hits different when you're losing balance at the chasm's edge. This won't make you happy. It's not fun. If you have neurotic tendencies, or you're a ruminator, if you get sad sometimes, or somebody depends on you — *then get the hell out!* Go home to your girlfriend, live a normal happy life, watch netflix. Just set an alarm for work tomorrow. *Close this now!*

Still here? You can't be deterred? You really are an arrogant fucker.

You want to do something extraordinary? Well, you don't get to have an ordinary life anymore. That was a privilege, and you just sold it. *Work-life balance,* are you kidding me? Carmack and Blow would like a word with you. And don't forget: every time you fail, you'll have nobody to blame but yourself, and nobody should feel sorry for you. You chose this.

A lust for fat stacks of cash? *Boats 'n hoes?* Forget it! Maybe you'll get that in the end, but in the meantime, may I interest you instead with decades of uncertainty, stress, and workaholism?

Do you have an inexhaustible inner flame? Do you crave power, or recognition? Are you doing God's work? Whatever dude, it better be some deep-rooted psychological shit for you to work out with your therapist. Actually, don't — it works better this way.

### Have you at least been doing your homework?

Doesn't it seem like all these damn startup books are written by "people-people"? Impress an angel investor. Hiring is about *culture.* The *bay area!* But hold on — didn't somebody have to actually *build* this shit?

Fine, you can keep your pg essays.

This book is not written in retrospect. It's about building. It's about the builder's mind. It's about you, your keyboard, and your demons.

This is about what you must become.
