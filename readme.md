# FOUNDER BE DAMNED
&nbsp; &nbsp; — *by Chase Moskal*

<br/>

## Chapter 1: *Fuck you*

Deciding to become a tech founder was an overconfident, grandiose, and arrogant thing for you to do. And you deserve to be punished. And you will be.

You are *inadequate.* You will fail. You'll disappoint yourself. Friends and family will lose faith in you. You'll become a drain. You'll let everybody down. Everybody will argue against you. They'll even *hope* for you to fail. *See? I told you...*

But don't you deserve it, really? After all, you're being *cosmically* arrogant.

### Delusions of grandeur

A cheap laptop is all you need to touch the lives of millions. If only you knew how to type the right keystrokes to pull it off.

Imagine trying to become a StarCraft grandmaster. How many games would you lose? Stomped. Humiliated. Stupid mistakes! The path of the technical founder, the true builder, is no different. Well except that StarCraft is supposed to be fun, right?

But, maybe you won't fail building your first product? You could get lucky on your first swing. But then what about the second? Or maybe you're already adequate for the task. You won't have any catastrophes! You're just as great as your parents, teachers, and bosses have told you. Yeah, okay... you really should get into StarCraft, maybe Serral's online.

Here's the thing: people *do* achieve grandmaster rank. Watch their twitch streams: are these guys god-gifted ubermensch wizards, or have they just played tens of thousands of games and lost about half as many? If you're at least a midwit, and you made it your life goal, do you think you could become a grandmaster one day?

Can you become a grandmaster at making cool shit that people love?

### Eating broken glass and staring into the abyss

*Victory or death!* Feels good to say, doesn't it?

Feels different when you're losing balance at the chasm's edge. This won't make you happy. It's not fun. If you have neurotic tendencies, or you're a ruminator, if you get sad sometimes, or people depend on you — *then get the hell out!* Bail! Live a normal happy life. Go home to your girlfriend, watch netflix, and get ready for work tomorrow like a good boy. *Close this now!*

Still here? You can't be deterred? You really are an arrogant fucker.

You want to do something extraordinary? Well, then you don't get to have an ordinary life anymore. That was a privilege, and you just sold it. Work-life balance, are you kidding me? Carmack and Blow would like a word with you. And don't forget: every time you fail, you'll have nobody to blame but yourself, and nobody should feel sorry for you. You chose this.

You'd better be driven by more than a lust for "boats 'n hoes" and "fat stacks of cash". Maybe you'll get that in the end, but in the meantime, may I interest you instead with decades of uncertainty, stress, and workaholism?

Do you have an inexhaustible inner flame? Do you need power, or recognition? Are you doing God's work? Whatever dude, it better be some deeply-rooted psychological shit for you to work out with your therapist. Actually, don't — it works better this way.

### Have you at least been doing your homework?

Doesn't it seem like all these damn startup books are written by "people-people"? Impress an angel investor. Hiring is about *culture.* The *bay area!* But hold on — didn't somebody have to actually *build* this shit?

Fine. You can keep *zero to one*, the old yc vids, and the pg essays.

This "book" or whatever, is not written in retrospect. It's about building. It's about the builder's mind. It's about you, your keyboard, and your demons.

This is about what you must become.
